# SALSA: A tool to scaffold long read assemblies with Hi-C 


This code is used to scaffold your assemblies using Hi-C data. To use the code first run the following command:
```
  cd SALSA
  make
```

To run the code, you will need [BOOST](http://www.boost.org/) libraries and [Networkx](https://networkx.github.io/).

is easy to run on its own as well. You can tweak the parameters in the files to suit your data and run the whole pipeline.

If you consider using this tool, please cite our publication which describes the methods used for scaffolding.
